"""This script takes in two city names as input and outputs the differences in
weather between the cities over the next 5 days.

Usage example:

    python compare_forecasts.py Toronto Cleveland

Output example:

    Weather forecast comparison between Toronto and Cleveland:

    Day 1:
    Toronto (18C) will be 3C cooler than Cleveland (21C).
    Toronto will have clear sky, but Cleveland will have rain.

    Day 2:
    Toronto (21C) will be 3C warmer than Cleveland (18C).
    Toronto will have scattered clouds, but Cleveland will have light rain.

    Day 3:
    Toronto and Cleveland will both have the same temperature (20C).
    Toronto and Cleveland will both have light rain.

    Day 4:
    Toronto (18C) will be 3C cooler than Cleveland (21C).
    Toronto and Cleveland will both have light rain.

    Day 5:
    Toronto and Cleveland will both have the same temperature (17C).
    Toronto will have scattered clouds, but Cleveland will have light rain.

Some considerations for this assignment:
    - The version of Python used is Python 3.6.6
    - To enter a city as an input with more than one word, put "" around it. Example, "Sao Paulo"
    - Since the assignment stated that the data for temperature and weather descriptions must come from the OpenWeatherMap's API, there are some
      weather descriptions such as 'sky is clear' (which should ideally say 'clear sky'), but that is the exact data provided from the API
    - Since there are multiple temperatures from the API response data, I have chosen to take the 'maximum temperature' value for each day, and I have
      rounded it up to the nearest integer.
